## Project Proposal: FEMAp - SaaS Database for Emergency Preparedness
### Project Overview:
The FEMAp project aims to create a SaaS database for emergency preparedness, providing users with customized checklists based on FEMA's recommended emergency lists. The system will generate printable/interactive PDFs with the user's selected emergencies and supply lists. It will also include user registration for saving lists and Google authentication for security. Scalable features include an interactive map, a chatbot, top ten tips for each emergency, a book/guide reference section, and product price and website lookup.
